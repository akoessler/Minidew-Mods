## Notice

I am currently too busy to work on/release many of these mods. I welcome anyone
to take them (especially the unreleased ones!).

## Configuration:
There are only four different true/false options in config.json:

* HeartRequirement: How many hearts are required to dance. This must be at
least 0 or at most 13. It is 4 by default (Vanilla).
