# Isaac's Minidew Mods

A collection of small mods for small tweaks in Stardew Valley. All of these mods
require SMAPI (1.10+, designed for 2.1+).

Current Mods:
* [Friends Forever](./FriendsForever/) - Prevents decay of friendships
* [Speedy Paths](./SpeedyPaths/) - Makes it so paths you place (and
some in town) give you a speed boost.
