# Isaac's Minidew Mods

A collection of small mods for small tweaks in Stardew Valley. All of these mods
require SMAPI (2.10.2+).

## Notice

I am currently too busy to work on/release many of these mods. I welcome anyone
to take them (especially the unreleased ones!).

## Current Mods

* [Any Heart Dance](./AnyHeartDance/) - Allows you to configure how many hearts
are required for the dance (unreleased).
* [Friends Forever](./FriendsForever/) - Prevents decay of friendships
* [Speedy Paths](./SpeedyPaths/) - Makes it so paths you place (and
some in town) give you a speed boost (unreleased).
